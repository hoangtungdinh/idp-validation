To run the IDP models, IDP needs to be downloaded from [here](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/software/idp/try). You can run the IDP models using the following command.

`path-to-the-downloaded-folder/usr/local/bin/idp sdw-model-checker.idp`

`path-to-the-downloaded-folder/usr/local/bin/idp rss-model-checker.idp`

You can read the IDP models using any text editor. However, we recommend using the [offline version of the IDP editor](https://sourceforge.net/projects/idp/files/idp-ide/) so that all the logical operators can be displayed nicely.
